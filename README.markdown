this whole readme is useless anyway it's about the other bot

but to use this for your own thing just change this line here: https://github.com/brendan10211/fuckeveryword/blob/master/main.py#L45 to whatever you want to tweet before or after the word. then create an application on appspot, deploy this, hit create, and hopefully it starts tweeting. i have no idea if it will work or not. you can contact me on twitter if you need support: @brendan10211

also you need to create a twitter app. aparrish does a much better job explaining this than i do, check the original repository. cheers!
